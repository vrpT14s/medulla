# Full list of columns of MPIIO table (A record represents how a certain rank interacted with a certain file_name)
rank: MPI rank (process ID within job)
file_name: Path of the file accessed

module: Module name that generated this record
record_id: Unique identifier for this record. More records != more usage! Few records can move many bytes compared to many records moving few bytes.
mount_pt: Mount point of the filesystem
fs_type: Type of filesystem

## Gross I/O size and operation counts
MPIIO_INDEP_READS: Number of independent reads
MPIIO_COLL_READS: Number of collective reads
MPIIO_NB_READS: Number of non-blocking reads
MPIIO_SPLIT_READS: Number of split reads
MPIIO_BYTES_READ: Total bytes read from this file

MPIIO_INDEP_WRITES: Number of independent writes
MPIIO_COLL_WRITES: Number of collective writes
MPIIO_NB_WRITES: Number of non-blocking writes
MPIIO_SPLIT_WRITES: Number of split writes
MPIIO_BYTES_WRITTEN: Total bytes written from this file

## Other operation counts
MPIIO_INDEP_OPENS: Number of independent opens
MPIIO_COLL_OPENS: Number of collective opens
MPIIO_SYNCS: Number of syncs
MPIIO_HINTS: Number of times MPI hints was used
MPIIO_VIEWS: Number of times MPI file views were used

## File info
MPIIO_MAX_BYTE_READ: Highest offset byte read
MPIIO_MAX_BYTE_WRITTEN: Highest offset byte written

## 4 most common sizes (This does not tell you the access sizes of all requests, only the 4 most common and their frequencies)
MPIIO_ACCESS1_ACCESS: First most common access size
MPIIO_ACCESS1_COUNT: Number of requests with this access size
MPIIO_ACCESS2_ACCESS: Second most common access size
MPIIO_ACCESS2_COUNT: Number of requests with this access size
MPIIO_ACCESS3_ACCESS: Third most common access size
MPIIO_ACCESS3_COUNT: Number of requests with this access size
MPIIO_ACCESS4_ACCESS: Fourth most common access size
MPIIO_ACCESS4_COUNT: Number of requests with this access size
> If one of the access counts are zero, this means that the application did not have 4 unique sizes but less than 4, thus the access counters contains all the information necessary for all sizes. In general, you can find out how complete this breakdown is by comparing the sum of frequencies here versus the sum of read and write operations globally.

## Rank variability and performance (only present in shared files)
MPIIO_FASTEST_RANK: Rank of the process with fastest I/O
MPIIO_FASTEST_RANK_BYTES: Bytes transferred by fastest rank
MPIIO_F_FASTEST_RANK_TIME: Fastest I/O time observed for any rank
MPIIO_SLOWEST_RANK: Rank of process with slowest I/O
MPIIO_SLOWEST_RANK_BYTES: Bytes transferred by slowest rank
MPIIO_F_SLOWEST_RANK_TIME: Slowest I/O time observed for any rank

MPIIO_F_VARIANCE_RANK_BYTES: Variance of total bytes moved across ranks
MPIIO_F_VARIANCE_RANK_TIME: Variance of total I/O time across ranks

MPIIO_F_MAX_READ_TIME: Duration of slowest read operation
MPIIO_F_MAX_WRITE_TIME: Duration of slowest write operation
MPIIO_MAX_READ_TIME_SIZE: Size of the slowest read operation
MPIIO_MAX_WRITE_TIME_SIZE: Size of the slowest write operation

## Cumulative time for operations
MPIIO_F_READ_TIME: Cumulative time spent in reads
MPIIO_F_WRITE_TIME: Cumulative time spent in writes
MPIIO_F_META_TIME: Cumulative time in metadata operations

## Operation start/end timestamps
MPIIO_F_OPEN_START_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of first open 
MPIIO_F_OPEN_END_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of last open
MPIIO_F_READ_START_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of first read
MPIIO_F_READ_END_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of last read
MPIIO_F_WRITE_START_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of first write
MPIIO_F_WRITE_END_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of last write
MPIIO_F_CLOSE_START_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of first close
MPIIO_F_CLOSE_END_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of last close
