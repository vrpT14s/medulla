# Full list of columns of STDIO table (A record represents how a rank interacted with a file_name)
rank: MPI rank (process ID within job)
file_name: Path of the file accessed

module: Module name that generated this record
record_id: Unique identifier for this record
mount_pt: Mount point of the filesystem
fs_type: Type of filesystem

## Gross I/O size and operation counts
STDIO_READS: Number of reads
STDIO_BYTES_READ: Total bytes read from this file

STDIO_WRITES: Number of writes
STDIO_BYTES_WRITTEN: Total bytes written from this file

## Other operation counts
STDIO_OPENS: Number of opens
STDIO_SEEKS: Number of seeks

## File info
STDIO_MAX_BYTE_READ: Highest offset byte read
STDIO_MAX_BYTE_WRITTEN: Highest offset byte written

## Rank variability and performance (only present in shared files)
STDIO_FASTEST_RANK: Rank of the process with fastest I/O
STDIO_FASTEST_RANK_BYTES: Bytes transferred by fastest rank
STDIO_F_FASTEST_RANK_TIME: Fastest I/O time observed for any rank
STDIO_SLOWEST_RANK: Rank of process with slowest I/O
STDIO_SLOWEST_RANK_BYTES: Bytes transferred by slowest rank
STDIO_F_SLOWEST_RANK_TIME: Slowest I/O time observed for any rank

STDIO_F_VARIANCE_RANK_BYTES: Variance of total bytes moved across ranks
STDIO_F_VARIANCE_RANK_TIME: Variance of total I/O time across ranks

## Cumulative time for operations
MPIIO_F_READ_TIME: Cumulative time spent in reads
MPIIO_F_WRITE_TIME: Cumulative time spent in writes
MPIIO_F_META_TIME: Cumulative time in metadata operations

## Operation start/end timestamps
STDIO_F_OPEN_START_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of first open 
STDIO_F_OPEN_END_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of last open
STDIO_F_READ_START_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of first read
STDIO_F_READ_END_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of last read
STDIO_F_WRITE_START_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of first write
