# Full list of columns of POSIX table (A record represents how a certain rank interacted with a certain file_name)
rank: MPI rank (process ID within job)
file_name: Path of the file accessed

module: Module name that generated this record
record_id: Unique identifier for this record
mount_pt: Mount point of the filesystem
fs_type: Type of filesystem

## Gross I/O size and operation counts
POSIX_READS: Number of read operation
POSIX_BYTES_READ: Total bytes read from this file
POSIX_WRITES: Number of write operation
POSIX_BYTES_WRITTEN: Total bytes written from this file

## File size indicators
POSIX_MAX_BYTE_READ: Highest offset byte read (add one to approximate filesize)
POSIX_MAX_BYTE_WRITTEN: Highest offset byte written (add one to approximate filesize)

## 4 most common sizes (This does not tell you the access sizes of all requests, only the 4 most common and their frequencies)
POSIX_ACCESS1_ACCESS: First most common access size
POSIX_ACCESS1_COUNT: Number of requests with this access size
POSIX_ACCESS2_ACCESS: Second most common access size
POSIX_ACCESS2_COUNT: Number of requests with this access size
POSIX_ACCESS3_ACCESS: Third most common access size
POSIX_ACCESS3_COUNT: Number of requests with this access size
POSIX_ACCESS4_ACCESS: Fourth most common access size
POSIX_ACCESS4_COUNT: Number of requests with this access size
> If one of the access counts are zero, this means that the application did not have 4 unique sizes but less than 4, thus the access counters contains all the information necessary for all sizes. In general, you can find out how complete this breakdown is by comparing the sum of frequencies here versus the sum of read and write operations globally.

## Access patterns
POSIX_CONSEC_READS: Number of exactly adjacent reads
POSIX_CONSEC_WRITES: Number of exactly adjacent writes
POSIX_SEQ_READS: Number of sequential reads (increasing offsets)
POSIX_SEQ_WRITES: Number of sequential writes (increasing offsets)

POSIX_RW_SWITCHES: Number of times access alternated between read and write

## 4 most common sizes (This does not tell you the access sizes of all requests, only the 4 most common and their frequencies)
> (strides are the difference in offsets between subsequent read/write requests)
POSIX_STRIDE1_STRIDE: First most common stride size
POSIX_STRIDE1_COUNT: Number of requests with this stride
POSIX_STRIDE2_STRIDE: Second most common stride size
POSIX_STRIDE2_COUNT: Number of requests with this stride
POSIX_STRIDE3_STRIDE: Third most common stride size
POSIX_STRIDE3_COUNT: Number of requests with this stride
POSIX_STRIDE4_STRIDE: Fourth most common stride size
POSIX_STRIDE4_COUNT: Number of requests with this stride
> Only use this information if you can be sure that most of the strides are in this table, i.e. there aren't many distinct strides. You can check this by adding all the counts and comparing it to the total reads plus the total writes (since the total number of strides will number of reads - 1 + number of writes - 1)

## Other operation counts
POSIX_OPENS: Number of opens
POSIX_DUPS: Number of file descriptor duplications (not duplicate reads/writes)
POSIX_FSYNCS: Number of fsync calls
POSIX_FDSYNCS: Number of fdatasync calls
POSIX_FILENOS: Number of fileno calls (retrieve file descriptor)
POSIX_STATS: Number of stat calls
POSIX_SEEKS: Number of seeks
POSIX_MMAPS: Number of mmap calls (usually -1 meaning not detected)

## Alignment
POSIX_FILE_ALIGNMENT: File alignment used for I/O
POSIX_FILE_NOT_ALIGNED: Number of unaligned file operations
POSIX_MEM_ALIGNMENT: Memory alignment used for I/O
POSIX_MEM_NOT_ALIGNED: Number of unaligned memory accesses

## Cumulative time for operations
POSIX_F_READ_TIME: Cumulative time spent in reads
POSIX_F_WRITE_TIME: Cumulative time spent in writes
POSIX_F_META_TIME: Cumulative time in metadata operations

## Operation start/end timestamps
POSIX_F_OPEN_START_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of first open
POSIX_F_OPEN_END_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of last open
POSIX_F_READ_START_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of first read
POSIX_F_READ_END_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of last read
POSIX_F_WRITE_START_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of first write
POSIX_F_WRITE_END_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of last write
POSIX_F_CLOSE_START_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of first close
POSIX_F_CLOSE_END_TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of last close

## Rank variability and performance (only present in shared files)
POSIX_FASTEST_RANK: Rank of the process with fastest I/O
POSIX_FASTEST_RANK_BYTES: Bytes transferred by fastest rank
POSIX_F_FASTEST_RANK_TIME: Fastest I/O time observed for any rank
POSIX_SLOWEST_RANK: Rank of process with slowest I/O
POSIX_SLOWEST_RANK_BYTES: Bytes transferred by slowest rank
POSIX_F_SLOWEST_RANK_TIME: Slowest I/O time observed for any rank

POSIX_F_VARIANCE_RANK_BYTES: Variance of total bytes moved across ranks
POSIX_F_VARIANCE_RANK_TIME: Variance of total I/O time across ranks

## Slowest operation times and the size for this (max across all ranks if a shared file)
POSIX_F_MAX_READ_TIME: Duration of slowest read operation
POSIX_F_MAX_WRITE_TIME: Duration of slowest write operation
POSIX_MAX_READ_TIME_SIZE: Size of the slowest read operation
POSIX_MAX_WRITE_TIME_SIZE: Size of the slowest write operation

> Small reads/writes for parallel file systems are usually considered to be less than 1 MB, while tiny reads are considered to be less than 1 KB.
