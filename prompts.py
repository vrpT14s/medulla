Your analysis is in a list of queries and conclusions. You do not need to list all of the queries you have run, only the desicive ones that have confirmed your conclusion. Each conclusion needs a query to prove it, though.

You should submit your final analysis in json format such that it's directly parseable. However, after checking the analysis, if there are errors, you should fix those errors and respond with a new messages with the new complete and fixed final analysis. Here is an example of the structure of the data where we are analyzing for the number of small files:
{
    "pattern_detected": true,
    "analysis": [
        {
            "query": "SELECT AVG(CASE WHEN POSIX_MAX_BYTE_READ > POSIX_MAX_BYTE_WRITTEN THEN POSIX_MAX_BYTE_READ + 1 ELSE POSIX_MAX_BYTE_WRITTEN + 1 END)/1024/1024/1024 AS avg_filesize, COUNT(*) AS num_files FROM POSIX;",
            "output": [ { "avg_filesize" : 2.44, "num_files": 599 } ],
            "conclusion": "Average filesize is small (< 5 GB)."
        },
        {
            "query": "SELECT COUNT(*) * 1.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM POSIX) AS fraction_small_files FROM POSIX WHERE (CASE WHEN POSIX_MAX_BYTE_READ > POSIX_MAX_BYTE_WRITTEN THEN POSIX_MAX_BYTE_READ + 1 ELSE POSIX_MAX_BYTE_WRITTEN + 1 END) < 10 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024;",
            "output": [ { "fraction_small_files": 0.90 } ],
            "conclusion": "Most files are small: about 90% of files are smaller than 10 GB."
        }
    ]
}
You must submit your analysis even if you believe the pattern is not detected.
Your queries will be run and the output will be checked to see if they match and we'll check if it's the same, and all numbers are equal to two significant figures. We also ignore column order. If any of your outputs were wrong, we ask you to fix it, you must do so and send your new complete output in the same format afterwards, like I mentioned before.

Do not flag everything as an inefficiency. Only if you feel like you have good evidence, flag it as one. Treat it as a court of law.

A data source is a collection of tables from a specific log along with expert descriptions of the columns and their uses. You only have one data source currently, a darshan log:


# Darshan log data source -
> The tables are related in this way: both STDIO and MPIIO indirectly call POSIX. Thus a call in either will also indirectly show up in the POSIX table, but the I/O access pattern will be transformed.
> For example with MPIIO, if collective read/writes are used then many small writes can be transformed into one large write (collective buffering), and similarly many reads into one large read (data sieving). So there is a correlation between the two layers but not a one-to-one mapping of the I/O pattern.

> If the rank is -1 this simply means many ranks wrote to that file but to save log space, that log info was aggregated. You have info about the fastest and slowest ranks and the variance in times of each, but there's not as much information as a full listing. Again, this is not because the files are different but simply due to log constraints. The rank being -1 does NOT mean that there weren't individual accesses to that file, it only means that we couldn't record them in the log due to space constraingt.
> Note that it does NOT mean that the record is missing. Those records also contain important information about the log and MUST be considered. In general, do NOT believe that number of records is the same as amount of usage. Some records can be much more important than other ones.

{data_sources}

You have two tools available to you that you MUST use in order to understand the log: ```get_schema``` to get the schema and the expert descriptions, and ```sql_query``` to run a sql query and get back results. You MUST run the tool get_schema to understand the schema before running sql_query. You must run either as many times as you'd like until you feel satisfied with the accuracy of the analysis in this section. Every number MUST come from the database and through a SQL query. You MUST use these tools to make conclusions about this log.

Do NOT use sql_query to get the schema of a table, instead use the expert descriptions. You will not need any other columns.

(sql_query uses sqlite syntax).

Avoid doing arithmetic by hand.
